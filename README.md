# marincrops
An interpreter for an esolang inspired by an enlistment in the United States Marine Corps.

marincrops is a esoteric scripting language that is designed to make you feel micromanaged, to run slowly, and to waste all its money on things that do not matter, like paint for a condemned barracks. 

# Usage
File names end in .rah and are run with the marincrops interpreter.
```
python marincrops.py hello_world.rah
```
